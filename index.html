        <h2>Briefly about myself</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Yaroslav, a web developer from Ukraine. I was born in Ukraine on June 23, 2004. 
          I am currently living in West Germany.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Development</h2>
          <h3>Beginning</h3>
            <p>I have been involved in web development since 2016. I started with the basics - HTML / CSS,
              building simple pages to get acquainted with this technology.
            </p>
          <h3>Back-end</h3>
            <p>Over the years, I started using php, experimenting with its capabilities. I did not use frameworks for php, 
              because I did not know about their existence at that time. Around the end of 2017, in the beginning of 2018, 
              I discovered Python and its popular web framework Django. My beginnings in Python began with this framework, 
              which helped me learn about professional web development, as it looks in large projects. He also studied the 
              work of the HTTP protocol much better, learned to create APIs, use ORM.
            </p>
            <h3>Web</h3>
            <hr style="max-width:30%;margin-right:70%"/>
            <h3>Django</h3>
            <hr style="max-width:15%;margin-right:85%"/>
              <p>
                This framework is predominant in my web development experience. Here are the projects I created based on it:
                  <br/>
                  <br/><a href="https://github.com/koval01/qwriter" target="_blank">Q-Writer</a> - I originally created 
                  this project to display records of my Telegram bot, a bot that complemented the text sent by the user. 
                  All these additions could be viewed using the site in tape format. I later rewrote this site for the news.
                  <br/>
                  <br/><a href="https://github.com/koval01/aware_site" target="_blank">AWSE</a> - this project is more 
                  complicated and I worked on it more time. The idea for the project was initially simple, similar 
                  to DuckDuckGo. Give the user the opportunity to search for information on the Internet without worrying 
                  about their privacy. In general, this goal was achieved, all requests passed through the site's server, 
                  even photos from other sites were proxied. Also in the project there were news, built-in functions, 
                  such as: translator, calculator, password generator, video playback from YouTube, which also slipped 
                  through our server (later I gave up this idea due to lack of funds). You can see the screenshots of 
                  this site that I have saved.&nbsp;
                  (
                    <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/HDjf9dxQ2LFrJAf6A" target="_blank">Screenshots</a>
                    or

                  )
                  <br/>
                  <br/><a href="https://github.com/koval01/imager_bot" target="_blank">Imager</a> - This is a project I'm 
                  currently working on, it's not entirely built on Django, but it uses it for administration. In general, 
                  the credit of this project, I got a lot of new things about Django Admin, its capabilities, customization, 
                  settings. More details about this project in the aiogram section.
              </p>

            <h3>Flask</h3>
            <hr style="max-width:15%;margin-right:85%"/>
              <p>
                This is the second framework I use to create a Python backend. Mostly I use this framework to write a simple
                web server as quickly as possible. And in most cases it's middleware for third-party APIs. Here are the 
                projects in which I used it:
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="https://github.com/koval01/okex_spot_viewer" target="_blank">OKX Spot Viewer</a> - layer for 
                OKX API (unofficial access), which I used to monitor my spots on the OKX cryptocurrency exchange. I was 
                actively improving this project, but due to lack of time I left it, perhaps temporarily.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="https://github.com/koval01/quote_getter" target="_blank">Quote Getter</a> - is a simple API 
                that translates quotes from English into the language I need.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="https://github.com/koval01/messenger-backend" target="_blank">Back-end for messenger</a> - 
                I had an attempt to write a messenger backend, but I postponed this project until better times, because 
                I'm not sure I can implement it on my own, and my skills in mobile development are meager.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="https://github.com/koval01/endlessness_backend" target="_blank">Endlessness (Back-end)</a> - 
                is an API that unofficially retrieves content from Instagram.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="https://github.com/koval01/filehostinger_bot/blob/master/file_api/http_server.py" 
                        target="_blank">File hostinger (Telegram BOT)</a> - I also used Flask to service HTTP interaction in 
                the Telegram bot File hostinger.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="https://github.com/koval01/image_generator" target="_blank">Profile-image generator</a> - 
                is an API built on Flask and Pillow that generates an image profile.
              </p>
            <h3>Telegram</h3>
            <hr style="max-width:30%;margin-right:70%"/>
            <h3>aiogram</h3>
            <hr style="max-width:15%;margin-right:85%"/>
              <p>
                In addition to web development, I also created bots for Telegram Messenger. It has a very flexible API 
                and is also free. Therefore, it is very interesting to use and explore it. Here are the projects 
                I created with aiogram:
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="https://github.com/koval01/coiner" target="_blank">Coiner</a> - primitive economic game in 
                it you need to raise money by being active in groups where there is this bot, for which the bot donates 
                money. You can also try to get a valuable item through roulette, or buy yourself slaves who will do 
                everything for you.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="https://github.com/koval01/filehostinger_bot" target="_blank">File hostinger</a> - this 
                bot uses the Telegram BOT API feature, the messenger allows you to download files via HTTP from 
                Telegram servers, but weighing no more than 20 megabytes, this is enough to place a photo or a small
                video. The bot acts as a manager between the Telegram and the user. All you have to do is upload the 
                file to the chat with the bot, then the bot will perform all the actions from the API, and provide a
                link where you can view the media file (not just media).
              </p>
            <hr style="max-width:35%"/>
          <h3>Front-end</h3>
            <p>I also have the skills to develop a frontend, as I worked on my own projects. Familiar with the popular 
              framework for JS - jQuery. General CSS capabilities, and HTML markup design. Also acquainted with the modified 
              version of CSS - Sass. For example, I created this page myself, relying on my newcomers to the frontend.

          <p>I graduated from a secondary school in Ukraine (11th grade), I have a secondary education. I studied programming
            on my own, researching someone else's code on GitHub, experimenting, reading documentation for various 
            libraries. I also had the opportunity to talk to more experienced people who are already working in IT, 
            who shared some of their experience with me.
