        <h2>Briefly about myself</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Yaroslav, a web developer from Ukraine. I was born in Ukraine on June 23, 2004. 
          I am currently living in West Germany.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Development</h2>
          <h3>Beginning</h3>
            <p>
              I have been involved in web development since 2016. I started with the basics - HTML / CSS,
              building simple pages to get acquainted with this technology.
            </p>
          <h3>Back-end</h3>
            <p>
              Over the years, I started using php, experimenting with its capabilities. I did not use frameworks for php, 
              because I did not know about their existence at that time. Around the end of 2017, in the beginning of 2018, 
              I discovered Python and its popular web framework Django. My beginnings in Python began with this framework, 
              which helped me learn about professional web development, as it looks in large projects. He also studied the 
              work of the HTTP protocol much better, learned to create APIs, use ORM.
            </p>
            <h3>Web</h3>
            <hr style="max-width:30%;margin-right:70%"/>
            <h3>Django</h3>
            <hr style="max-width:15%;margin-right:85%"/>
              <p>
                This framework is predominant in my web development experience. Here are the projects I created based on it:
                  <br/>
                  <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/qwriter" target="_blank">Q-Writer</a> - I originally created 
                  this project to display records of my Telegram bot, a bot that complemented the text sent by the user. 
                  All these additions could be viewed using the site in tape format. I later rewrote this site for the news.
                  <br/>
                  <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/aware_site" target="_blank">AWSE</a> - this project is more 
                  complicated and I worked on it more time. The idea for the project was initially simple, similar 
                  to DuckDuckGo. Give the user the opportunity to search for information on the Internet without worrying 
                  about their privacy. In general, this goal was achieved, all requests passed through the site's server, 
                  even photos from other sites were proxied. Also in the project there were news, built-in functions, 
                  such as: translator, calculator, password generator, video playback from YouTube, which also slipped 
                  through our server (later I gave up this idea due to lack of funds). You can see the screenshots of 
                  this site that I have saved.&nbsp;
                  (
                    <a href="//photos.app.goo.gl/HDjf9dxQ2LFrJAf6A" target="_blank">Screenshots</a>
                    or

                  )
                  <br/>
                  <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/imager_bot" target="_blank">Imager</a> - This is a project I'm 
                  currently working on, it's not entirely built on Django, but it uses it for administration. In general, 
                  the credit of this project, I got a lot of new things about Django Admin, its capabilities, customization, 
                  settings. More details about this project in the aiogram section.
              </p>
            <hr style="max-width:15%;margin-left:85%"/>
            <h3>Flask</h3>
            <hr style="max-width:15%;margin-right:85%"/>
              <p>
                This is the second framework I use to create a Python backend. Mostly I use this framework to write a simple
                web server as quickly as possible. And in most cases it's middleware for third-party APIs. Here are the 
                projects in which I used it:
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/okex_spot_viewer" target="_blank">OKX Spot Viewer</a> - layer for 
                OKX API (unofficial access), which I used to monitor my spots on the OKX cryptocurrency exchange. I was 
                actively improving this project, but due to lack of time I left it, perhaps temporarily.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/quote_getter" target="_blank">Quote Getter</a> - is a simple API 
                that translates quotes from English into the language I need.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/messenger-backend" target="_blank">Back-end for messenger</a> - 
                I had an attempt to write a messenger backend, but I postponed this project until better times, because 
                I'm not sure I can implement it on my own, and my skills in mobile development are meager.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/endlessness_backend" target="_blank">Endlessness (Back-end)</a> - 
                is an API that unofficially retrieves content from Instagram.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/filehostinger_bot/blob/master/file_api/http_server.py" 
                        target="_blank">File hostinger (Telegram BOT)</a> - I also used Flask to service HTTP interaction in 
                the Telegram bot File hostinger.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/image_generator" target="_blank">Profile-image generator</a> - 
                is an API built on Flask and Pillow that generates an image profile.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/coinerapi" target="_blank">Coiner API</a> - this is an API for my 
                Telegram-bot, it was my attempt to learn more about Flask-restful.
              </p>
            <hr style="max-width:15%;margin-left:85%"/>
            <h3>NodeJS (Express)</h3>
            <hr style="max-width:15%;margin-right:85%"/>
              <p>
                Although my acquaintance with this technology is actually superficial, but I liked it, maybe later I will dive 
                deeper into it. Here are some projects I created using it:
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/zlpnews_proxy" target="_blank">ZLP News</a> - is an API for 
                retrieving data for a game project page. In fact, this was my first acquaintance with Express, its use 
                in production, before that I used it only for experiments.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/okx_price" target="_blank">Prices from OKX</a> - is an API that receives 
                the currency price from the OKX exchange. I didn't want to think about the limits of the official OKX API, to deal 
                with it, so I just wrote this layer using Express.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/translate-heroku" target="_blank">Translate API on Heroku</a> - This is an 
                experiment project, I learned about the library for NodeJS, which allows you to access the Google Translate API, 
                which is used to serve users of Google itself, so I could use the translator for free.
              </p>
            <h3>Telegram</h3>
            <hr style="max-width:30%;margin-right:70%"/>
            <h3>aiogram</h3>
            <hr style="max-width:15%;margin-right:85%"/>
              <p>
                In addition to web development, I also created bots for Telegram Messenger. It has a very flexible API 
                and is also free. Therefore, it is very interesting to use and explore it. Here are the projects 
                I created with aiogram:
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/coiner" target="_blank">Coiner</a> - primitive economic game in 
                it you need to raise money by being active in groups where there is this bot, for which the bot donates 
                money. You can also try to get a valuable item through roulette, or buy yourself slaves who will do 
                everything for you.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/filehostinger_bot" target="_blank">File hostinger</a> - this 
                bot uses the Telegram BOT API feature, the messenger allows you to download files via HTTP from 
                Telegram servers, but weighing no more than 20 megabytes, this is enough to place a photo or a small
                video. The bot acts as a manager between the Telegram and the user. All you have to do is upload the 
                file to the chat with the bot, then the bot will perform all the actions from the API, and provide a
                link where you can view the media file (not just media).
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/imager_bot" target="_blank">Imager</a> - this project was 
                mentioned in the section with Django. The point of the bot is that users can add their media to 
                a shared collection, while others can view the collection in order or randomly. The bot independently 
                sorts the media by type, the user only needs to send them and everything. At the moment, the 
                development of the bot continues.
              </p>

          <h3>Front-end</h3>
            <p>
              I also have the skills to develop a frontend, as I worked on my own projects. Familiar with the popular 
              framework for JS - jQuery. General CSS capabilities, and HTML markup design. Also acquainted with the modified 
              version of CSS - Sass. For example, I created this page myself, relying on my newcomers to the frontend.

              Here are the projects that can be attributed to the category of frontend development:
              <br/>
              <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/zonechill" target="_blank">ZoneChill site</a> - this is the Telegram 
              page of the Chill Zone channel. I just liked this channel, so I decided to create a site for it, at the same 
              time to improve my skills in frontend development.
              <br/>
              <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/okex_monitor">OKX Monitor</a> - the frontend of the OKX spot monitoring 
              project. I have already mentioned the link to the backend of this project.
              <br/>
              <br/><a href="//github.com/koval01/SberCloud-GPT-3-Web">SberCloud GPT-3 Web</a> - this is my implementation
